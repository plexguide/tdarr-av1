# tdarr-av1

Here is a quick writeup to get you started so you do not have to guess. First, I utilized GIT: as a start, but some stuff was incomplete and did not make sense.

For this quick guide you will need:
1. Windows 10/11 Machine
2. An Intel ARC GPU
3. Tdarr setup and ready to. Recommend to put it in your C:\ (root)

Special Note 1: Enable automatic login on your PC. This is useful for recovery in the event of a system crash. If you're familiar with older programs like Plexguide, you'll recognize the superiority of Linux and Docker. Essentially, configure your machine to automatically resume operations after a reboot.

Special Note 2: Some folks might scoff at AV1, dismissing it as overhyped, irrelevant, or not the way forward. But here's the deal: I've seen AV1 compress a 5GB file down to a mere 1.5GB with hardly any quality compromise. And no, you don't need to break the bank with a $1600 4090. If you hear the "not every device can play it" argument, remember that a plethora of devices, including Plex and JellyFin, support AV1. Most users already own AV1-compatible devices. For the few who don't? A simple solution: upgrade to a new Android box or Apple TV. Why should you invest more in storage when they can't spring for a basic device? Using Plex with an Intel processor or ARC GPU? Good news: they handle AV1 like champs. And a pro tip for your pals: enable maximum bandwidth mode to avoid transcoding and enjoy direct streaming.
